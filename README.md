# SolarlikePeakbagging
This repos is to demonstrate a data reduction pipeline for solar-like oscillations.  
The main constributors are Mr. Yaguang Li from the University of Sydney and Dr. Tanda Li from the University of Birmingham. 

We provide an open source code package for the peak-bagging of solar-like oscillations. 

We also list the identified mode frequencies in our puplications.
