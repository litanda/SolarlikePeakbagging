# SolarlikePeakbagging

# Overview
This repos is to demonstrate a data reduction pipeline for solar-like oscillations.  
The main constributors are Mr. Yaguang Li from the University of Sydney and Dr. Tanda Li from the University of Birmingham. The code is also constributed by Mr. Du Minghao, a former Mater student in Beijing Normal University. 

We provide an open-source code package for the peak-bagging of solar-like oscillations. The source codes are in the script folder. Detailed descriptions of the method can be found in Li et al., 2020, MNRAS, 495,483 (doi: 10.1093/mnras/staa1335)

We also list the identified mode frequencies in our puplications. 

# Q&A:
Any questions about the code or Frequency lists, please raise an ISSUE in this repo. 

# Catations:
If you use the code in publications, please cite
