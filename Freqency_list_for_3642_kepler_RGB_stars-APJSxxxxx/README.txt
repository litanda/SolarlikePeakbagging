The csv file contains radial mode frequencies of 3,624 Kepler RGB stars in a recently submitted paper. 

Columns:
KIC: KIC ID
group: 
ifpublish: 0 is published before, 1 is not published before
ifradial: 0 is not a radial mode or unclear, 1 is a radial mode
PTamp: amplitude of the mode
PTeamp: uncertainty of the amplitude
PTlw: line width of the mode
PTelw: uncertainty of the line width
PTfc: mode frequency
PTefc: uncertainty of mode frequency
PTlnK: significance of detection (>5 means the signal is significantly strong)
PTelnK: uncertainty of significance of detection 

Note:

Although we screened most stars in our sample and found the frequencies reliable, it is possible that a few of the stars have incorrect results since they were returned from an automatic pipeline. They do not affect results of population studies because of their small number. However, if readers wish to use the frequency for any particular stars, they should carefully vet them before use.
